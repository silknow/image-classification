            Path including the filename of the csv file containing the data
            exported from the SILKNOW knowledge graph (by EURECOM) or to
            data that is structured in the same way. An example is given in
            https://github.com/silknow/image-classification/tree/master/silknow_image_classification/samples.
        :imgsavepath (*string*)\::
            Path to were the images shall be downloaded or were the beforehand
            downloaded images are stored. All images in the csv file (rawCSVFile)
            that fulfill the further user-defined requirements are considered,
            i.e. images in that director that are not part of the csv file won't be considered.
            All images have to be in the folder; subfolders are not considered.
        :master_file_dir (*string*)\::
            Path where the created master file will be stored. The master file contains all
            created collection files. These collection files contain the relative paths
            from masterfileDirectory to the images in imageSaveDirectory as well as the
            images' annotations.
        :minnumsamples (*int*)\::
            The minimum number of images that shall contribute to a certain class.
            Classes (e.g. Italy) with less than minNumSamplesPerClass samples are not considered
            for the variable (e.g. place) with that class (e.g. Italy), i.e. the class label is set
            to 'nan' (unknown).

            A list of the names of the museums in the csv file that shall be considered
            for the dataset creation.
        :num_labeled (*int*)\::
            The minimum number of labels that shall be available for a sample. If a sample
            has less labels, it won't be part of the created dataset. This number of labels is counted
            after potentially setting labels to 'nan' (unknown) due to the restrictions in
            minNumSamplesPerClass. The maximum number of labels is 5 in the current software
            implementation, i.e. one label for each of the five semantic variables
